It's Abinash. Data Science and analytics profressional based in the land Down Under. Other that working in this space, I'm a keen nature lover who likes hiking. I'm 100% mad about Heavy and Thrash Metal music. I'm a thrash metal drummer and draw inspiration from Metal drumming greats, shredding guitar greats and Pioneers in the field of science and tech. I also draw inspiration from the great outdoors. New Zealand is my favourite destination.
