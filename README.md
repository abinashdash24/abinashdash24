It's Abinash. Data Science and analytics profressional based in the land Down-Under. Other that working in this space, I'm a keen nature lover who likes hiking and mad
about Heavy and Thrash Metal music. I'm a thrash metal drummer and draw inspiration from Metal drummer greats and Pioneers in the field of science and tech. I also get
inspired by the great outdoors. New Zealand is my favourite destination.
